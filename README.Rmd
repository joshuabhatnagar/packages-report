## Overview

The goal of packages-report is to summarize the analysis of my R package installations.

```{r, include = FALSE}
## load data/add-on-packages-freqtable.csv here in this chunk
addOnPackagesFreqTable <- read_csv(here("data", "add-on-packages-freqtable.csv"))
```

I have `r sum(addOnPackagesFreqTable$n)` add-on packages installed.

Here's how they break down in terms of which version of R they were built under, which is related to how recently they were updated on CRAN.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
## print the frequency table here
knitr::kable(addOnPackagesFreqTable)
```

### Flow of the analysis

There are four scripts saved within the subdirectory `scripts` used to conduct the analysis:

1. The first script, `01_write-installed-packages.R`, creates a dataframe of my currently installed packages.
2. The second script, `02_wrangle-packages.R`, creates two files, one containing all of my add-on packages and another containing the break down in terms of which version of R the add-on packages were built under.
3. The third script, `03_barchart-packages-built.R`, creates a plot of the frequency table created in the second script.

To run the analysis in one easy step, the fourth script, `04_whole-analysis.R`, creates the necessary subdirectories if they don't exist and sources the first three scripts.
